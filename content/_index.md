Welcome!

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.png" >}}

[Dr. Thanuja Ambegoda](https://thanuj.lk/) leads the Artificial Intelligence Translational Research Lab (AITR Lab) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa. The group's focus is on applying foundational AI and machine learning methods to solve real-world problems across domains such as,

* Document Analysis,
* Computer Vision,
* Medical Imaging.

Research conducted at AITR Lab bridges theory and practice, resulting in both high-impact academic publications and practical systems. Current projects include AI-powered document digitization for low-resource languages, medical image analysis, and intelligent automation solutions.

_We are always looking for motivated postdocs, PhD students, and undergraduates who are interested in document analysis, computer vision, and medical imaging. Please thoroughly read our [Publications](/publications/) page before reaching out._
