# Publications
We are interested in building resource efficient intelligent systems, mainly performing intelligent tasks on image data such as medical imaging or video recordings. Here are some of the projects we've been working on.

## Medical Image Analysis and Diagnostic Assistance
<div class="description-block">
We work on image data such as X-Ray, CT, Electron Microscopy as well as Dermoscopic images. Our efforts are to create diagnostic assistive tools using computer visions methods that can analyze above types of images so that an informative judgement can be made by medical practitioners using the output of such methods. Following are some of our publications in this area

## Satellite Image Analysis / Remote Sensing
<div class="description-block">
In our research on satellite image analysis using computer vision, we explore Mars's surface to better understand its geology and potential for past life. One project involves segmenting serpentine zones on Mars, which helps in studying the planet's geological history. Another focuses on automatically detecting and segmenting non-inverted channels from satellite data, shedding light on Mars's ancient water flow. These efforts aim to provide insights into Mars's environment and support future exploration

## Sensors and Data Science
<div class="description-block">
There are a variety of sensors to capture events in the environment including machines and humans. These could be IMU sensors to detect acceleration, lidar sensors to sense the 3D environment and its changes, wifi transceivers that can capture certain changes in the environment, and vibration sensors that can capture subtle changes in machine vibrations when they are in operation . Our efforts are to develop and apply data science techniques to extract rich features and use them to build tools to support decision making for humans as well as autonomous agents such as robots

## Sign Language Recognition
<div class="description-block">
Our aim is to build an automatic realtime sign language recognition system for the Sinhala Sign Language that's used in Sri Lanka. We have developed tools to recognize the Sinhala Sign Alphabet as well as a number of words. Currently we are trying to expand the vocabulary as well as the capability to translate sentences in Sinhala Sign Language in realtime. We have already contributed the largest dataset for this purpose and currently working on expanding it further to support similar research and development efforts.
